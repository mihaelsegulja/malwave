# Malwave

A fast-paced wave-based arcade arena shooter where you fight off computer malware inside a neon cyberspace grid.

You are the system Administrator fighting off an onslaught of digital threats. Survive as long as you can by blasting viruses, avoiding annoying adware, and outsmarting trojans that spawn more viruses on death.

## Features

Each wave spawns more enemies, increasing the chaos and forcing constant movement

- **Player combat**
Simple twin-stick style shooting with directional aiming and lasers

- **Enemy types**
  - Virus: basic chaser
  - Trojan: spawns extra viruses on death
  - Adware: does not hurt you, but annoyingly stands in way

- **PowerUps**
  - Heal (+2 HP)
  - Max Health Up (+1 max HP and +1 heal)
  - Shield (2 seconds invincibility)

- **Dynamic tile effects**
  - Ambient pulses: random tiles briefly light up across the arena
  - Wave sweep: a horizontal line of tiles lights up from top to bottom at the start of each wave
